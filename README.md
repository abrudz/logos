# Programming Language Logos

## and repository for the official [APL](https://apl.wiki) logo

The official APL logo exists in a full colour edition, and in a black and a white monochrome version. Each one is rendered as SVG and PNG.

### Usage

There are no restrictions on the usage of the official APL logo, but for consistency, use the green logo in coloured contexts. If your design requires a single-colour logo, use either the black or white one, or recolour one of them as necessary.
